# Day 25: SDEdit (Image Editing)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement guided image editing using partial noise injection and denoising (SDEdit) for semantic image manipulation while preserving structure.

## 📋 Tasks

### SDEdit Implementation
- **Implement guided image editing using partial noise + denoising**
  - Take real image, add noise to intermediate timestep
  - Apply guided denoising with text or other conditions
  - Balance structure preservation vs semantic change

### Editing Applications
- **Multiple editing scenarios**
  - Style transfer (artistic styles, seasonal changes)
  - Object replacement and modification
  - Scene composition and background changes
  - Facial attribute editing

## 🧮 SDEdit Algorithm

### Core Process
```
1. Input: real image x_0, text prompt, noise level t₀
2. Forward: x_{t₀} = √(α̅_{t₀})x_0 + √(1-α̅_{t₀})ε
3. Reverse: x_{t₀} → x_{t₀-1} → ... → x_0' (with text guidance)
4. Output: edited image x_0'
```

### Noise Level Selection
- **Low noise (t₀ < 200)**: Subtle edits, preserve structure
- **Medium noise (t₀ = 200-500)**: Moderate changes
- **High noise (t₀ > 500)**: Dramatic transformations

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Experiment with different noise injection levels
- Use classifier-free guidance for text conditioning
- Implement masking for region-specific editing
- Add structural preservation losses if needed
- Consider DDIM for consistency across edits

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Before/after editing galleries
- Analysis of noise level vs editing strength
- Comparison of different guidance methods
- Evaluation of structure preservation
- User study or perceptual quality assessment

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Practical image editing with diffusion models
- Understanding controllability vs quality trade-offs
- Real-world application of diffusion techniques
