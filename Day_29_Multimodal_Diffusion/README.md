# Day 29: Multimodal Diffusion (Text + Image + Audio)

## 🎯 Objective
Train a toy multimodal diffusion model that can generate and understand relationships between text, images, and audio modalities.

## 📋 Tasks

### Multimodal Architecture
- **Train a toy multimodal model with paired modalities**
  - Design unified embedding space for text, image, audio
  - Implement cross-modal attention mechanisms
  - Handle different modality-specific encoders/decoders

### Cross-Modal Generation
- **Implement cross-modal generation tasks**
  - Text-to-image generation
  - Image-to-text generation (captioning)
  - Audio-to-image or image-to-audio synthesis
  - Joint text+image+audio understanding

## 🏗️ Multimodal Architecture

### Unified Framework
```
Modality Encoders → Shared Embedding Space → Cross-Modal Attention → Diffusion Process
```

### Key Components
- **Modality Encoders**: Text (CLIP), Image (Vision Transformer), Audio (Wav2Vec)
- **Shared Space**: Common dimensionality for all modalities
- **Cross-Attention**: Attend across different modality embeddings
- **Diffusion UNet**: Modified to handle multimodal conditioning

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Start with two modalities before adding third
- Use pre-trained encoders when possible (CLIP, Wav2Vec)
- Implement modality-specific positional encodings
- Handle missing modalities during training (random dropout)
- Consider computational constraints with multiple modalities

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Cross-modal generation examples
- Analysis of modality alignment in embedding space
- Evaluation of different modality combinations
- Comparison with single-modal baselines
- Investigation of emergent cross-modal behaviors

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding multimodal generative modeling
- Experience with cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Challenges in multimodal learning and generation

## 📖 Resources
- Multimodal deep learning surveys
- CLIP and similar multimodal models
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Audio processing for deep learning
