# Day 18: Rectified Flow (2023)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement rectified flow, a recent advancement that creates straighter flow trajectories for more efficient generation and training.

## 📋 Tasks

### Rectified Flow Implementation
- **Implement rectified flow objective**
  - Create straight-line flow paths between noise and data
  - Implement reflow procedure for trajectory rectification
  - Train neural network to predict velocity fields

### Efficiency Analysis
- **Compare training efficiency with FM/DDPM**
  - Training convergence speed
  - Sample quality with fewer function evaluations
  - Analysis of trajectory straightness

## 🧮 Rectified Flow Formulation

### Reflow Procedure
```
1. Train initial flow v_0
2. Generate samples using v_0: (x_0^i, x_1^i)
3. Reflow: train v_1 on straightened paths between (x_0^i, x_1^i)
4. Repeat for v_2, v_3, ... until convergence
```

### Straight Path Coupling
```
x_t = (1-t)x_0 + t x_1
v*(t, x_t) = x_1 - x_0
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Start with simple 2D toy problems to visualize trajectory straightening
