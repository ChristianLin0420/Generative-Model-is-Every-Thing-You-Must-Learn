# Day 12: Conditional Generation

## 🎯 Objective
Implement text-to-image conditioning using CLIP embeddings to enable semantic control over generated images.

## 📋 Tasks

### CLIP Integration
- **Implement text-to-image conditioning with CLIP embeddings**
  - Load pre-trained CLIP model for text/image embeddings
  - Modify diffusion model to accept CLIP text embeddings
  - Implement cross-attention mechanisms for text conditioning

### Dataset Training
- **Train on a small dataset (MS-COCO subset)**
  - Prepare text-image pairs from COCO captions
  - Create data pipeline for text embeddings and images
  - Train text-conditional diffusion model

## 🏗️ Architecture Modifications

### Text Conditioning
- **CLIP Text Encoder**: Extract text embeddings from captions
- **Cross-Attention**: Attend over text embeddings in UNet blocks
- **Text Projection**: Project CLIP embeddings to model dimension

### Modified UNet
```
Text Embedding → Cross-Attention Layers in UNet Blocks
Image Features ← Text-conditioned features
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use pre-trained CLIP (e.g., ViT-B/32) and freeze weights
- Add cross-attention after each self-attention in UNet
- Use classifier-free guidance with text conditioning
- Start with simple captions before complex descriptions
- Consider computational constraints with CLIP inference

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Text-to-image generation samples
- Comparison of conditioning strength (CFG scales)
- Analysis of semantic alignment between text and images
- Evaluation of caption following accuracy
- Failure case analysis and limitations

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding multimodal conditioning in diffusion
- Experience with cross-attention mechanisms
- Foundation for advanced text-to-image models
