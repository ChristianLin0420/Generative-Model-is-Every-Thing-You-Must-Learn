# ðŸš€ 30-Day Diffusion & Flow Matching Challenge

Welcome to the comprehensive 30-day challenge designed to master generative models, with a focus on diffusion models and flow matching techniques. This challenge will take you from foundational concepts to cutting-edge research implementations.

## Challenge Structure

### ðŸŽ¯ **Foundations (Day 1â€“7)**
Build core understanding of noise processes, autoencoders, and basic diffusion concepts.

### ðŸ”¥ **Core Diffusion (Day 8â€“15)**  
Master advanced diffusion techniques including guidance, latent diffusion, and conditional generation.

### ðŸš€ **Advanced Topics (Day 16â€“30)**
Explore state-of-the-art methods including flow matching, consistency models, and research-level implementations.

## Daily Folders

Each day has its own dedicated folder containing:
- ðŸ“‹ **README.md**: Detailed task description and learning objectives
- ðŸ’¾ **Code**: Implementation space for your solutions
- ðŸ“Š **Results**: Place to store outputs, visualizations, and analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of PyTorch/TensorFlow, machine learning fundamentals
2. **Setup**: Install required dependencies (see individual day requirements)
3. **Approach**: Spend 2-4 hours per day on implementation and experimentation
4. **Documentation**: Keep notes and results in each day's folder
