# Day 13: Image-to-Image Diffusion

## 🎯 Objective
Implement image editing capabilities using conditional noise injection and learn how to modify existing images while preserving structure.

## 📋 Tasks

### Image Editing Implementation
- **Implement image editing using conditional noise injection**
  - Take input image and add noise to intermediate timestep
  - Use text conditioning to guide the editing process
  - Preserve image structure while enabling semantic modifications

### Editing Techniques
- **Multiple editing approaches**
  - SDEdit-style: Add noise then denoise with new conditioning
  - Inpainting: Mask-based editing for specific regions
  - Style transfer: Change style while preserving content

## 🧮 Image Editing Formulations

### SDEdit Approach
```
1. Start with real image x_0
2. Add noise to timestep t: x_t = √(α̅_t)x_0 + √(1-α̅_t)ε
3. Denoise with new text conditioning: x_t → x_0'
```

### Inpainting
```
1. Mask region to edit
2. Apply diffusion only to masked region
3. Blend with original image outside mask
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Experiment with different noise injection levels (t ∈ [100, 500])
- Higher t = more dramatic edits, lower t = subtle modifications
- Use DDIM for consistency across edits
- Implement masking for region-specific editing
- Consider guidance scale for editing strength

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Before/after editing comparisons
- Analysis of noise level vs editing strength
- Region-specific editing demonstrations (inpainting)
- Style transfer examples
- Evaluation of structure preservation vs semantic change

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding controllable image manipulation
- Experience with partial diffusion processes
- Practical applications of diffusion models
