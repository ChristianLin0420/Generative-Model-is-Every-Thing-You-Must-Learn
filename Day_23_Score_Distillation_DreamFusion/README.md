# Day 23: Score Distillation (DreamFusion Style)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement score distillation sampling (SDS) for text-to-3D generation, learning how to use 2D diffusion models to guide 3D optimization.

## 📋 Tasks

### SDS Implementation
- **Implement score distillation for text-to-3D toy example**
  - Use 2D diffusion model as guidance for 3D scene
  - Implement differentiable rendering pipeline
  - Optimize 3D representation (NeRF-style or 3D Gaussian)

### 3D Optimization
- **Text-guided 3D generation**
  - Use text-to-image diffusion for guidance
  - Implement multi-view consistency
  - Handle Janus problem and other 3D artifacts

## 🧮 Score Distillation Sampling

### SDS Loss
```
∇_θ L_SDS = E_t,ε[w(t)(ε_φ(x_t; y, t) - ε) ∂x/∂θ]
where:
- x: rendered 2D image from 3D scene
- θ: 3D scene parameters
- ε_φ: pretrained 2D diffusion model
- w(t): weighting function
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Start with simple 3D representations (colored point clouds)
- Use pre-trained Stable Diffusion for guidance
- Implement differentiable rendering (PyTorch3D or similar)
- Add view-dependent effects for realism
- Monitor 3D consistency across different viewpoints

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Text-to-3D generation examples
- Multi-view renderings of generated 3D objects
- Analysis of 3D consistency and quality
- Comparison with other 3D generation methods
- Investigation of common failure modes (Janus problem)
