# Day 19: Consistency Models (2023)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement consistency models for ultra-fast 1-step image generation while maintaining quality comparable to multi-step diffusion models.

## 📋 Tasks

### Consistency Training
- **Implement consistency training for 1-step image generation**
  - Define consistency function f_θ
  - Implement self-consistency training objective
  - Handle boundary conditions properly

### Performance Evaluation
- **Compare 1-step vs multi-step generation**
  - Sample quality evaluation (FID, IS)
  - Generation speed benchmarks
  - Analysis of quality-speed trade-offs

## 🧮 Consistency Model Formulation

### Consistency Function
```
f_θ: (x_t, t) → x_0
```
- Maps any noisy input to clean output
- Satisfies self-consistency: f_θ(x_t, t) = f_θ(x_s, s) for any t, s

### Training Objective
```
L(θ) = E[t,x_0,n][d(f_θ(x_{t+1}, t+1), f_θ(x_t, t))]
```
- Enforces consistency across adjacent timesteps
- Use stop-gradient on one side to stabilize training

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use pre-trained diffusion model as teacher (distillation)
- Implement proper boundary conditions (f_θ(x_0, 0) = x_0)
- Use EMA updates for target network
- Start with smaller datasets before scaling up
- Monitor both consistency loss and sample quality

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- 1-step generation samples
- Quality comparison: 1-step vs 20-step vs 1000-step
- Generation speed benchmarks
- Training convergence analysis
- Failure case analysis and limitations

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding distillation-based acceleration
- Experience with 1-step generation techniques
- Insight into consistency training principles
