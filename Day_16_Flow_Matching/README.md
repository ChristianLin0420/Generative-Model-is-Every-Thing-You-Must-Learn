# Day 16: Flow Matching (FM)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement basic flow matching as an alternative to diffusion models, understanding continuous normalizing flows and their training objective.

## 📋 Tasks

### Flow Matching Implementation
- **Implement basic flow matching objective**
  - Define continuous vector field parameterization
  - Implement conditional flow matching (CFM) training
  - Use simple coupling strategies (e.g., optimal transport)

### Comparative Analysis
- **Compare with DDPM training**
  - Training stability and convergence speed
  - Sample quality evaluation
  - Computational efficiency comparison

## 🧮 Flow Matching Formulation

### Vector Field
```
v_θ(t, x_t): R × R^d → R^d
```
- Maps (time, state) to velocity vector
- Parameterized by neural network θ

### Training Objective
```
L_CFM(θ) = E[t,q(x_0,x_1)][||v_θ(t, x_t) - u_t(x_t|x_0, x_1)||²]
```

### Optimal Transport Coupling
- **Linear interpolation**: x_t = (1-t)x_0 + tx_1
- **Target velocity**: u_t(x_t|x_0, x_1) = x_1 - x_0

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use same UNet architecture as DDPM for fair comparison
- Replace time embedding with continuous time input
- Implement both linear and more complex couplings
- Monitor training stability (flow matching can be more stable)
- Use ODE solvers for sampling

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Training loss comparisons with DDPM
- Sample quality evaluation (FID scores)
- Training time and convergence analysis
- Vector field visualizations (for 2D toy problems)
- Sampling efficiency comparison
