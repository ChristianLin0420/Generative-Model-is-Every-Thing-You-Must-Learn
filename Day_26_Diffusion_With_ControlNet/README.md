# Day 26: Diffusion with ControlNet (2023)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement ControlNet for precise spatial control over diffusion models using structural guidance like edge maps, depth maps, or poses.

## 📋 Tasks

### ControlNet Implementation
- **Implement ControlNet for conditioning on edge maps or poses**
  - Add ControlNet branch to existing diffusion model
  - Train on paired data (image + control signal)
  - Enable precise spatial control during generation

### Control Applications
- **Multiple control modalities**
  - Canny edge maps for structure control
  - Human pose estimation for figure generation
  - Depth maps for 3D-aware generation
  - Segmentation maps for layout control

## 🏗️ ControlNet Architecture

### Dual-Branch Design
```
Original UNet (frozen) ← Cross-connection ← ControlNet Branch
           ↓                                        ↑
    Generated Image                         Control Input
```

### Training Strategy
- **Zero initialization**: Initialize connections to preserve original model
- **Frozen backbone**: Keep original diffusion model weights frozen
- **Control branch**: Train only ControlNet parameters

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use pre-trained diffusion model as base (don't train from scratch)
- Implement zero convolutions for stable training initialization
- Create or use existing control signal extractors (Canny, OpenPose)
- Balance control strength with generation diversity
- Handle multiple control inputs simultaneously

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Controlled generation examples with different control types
- Comparison of control strength levels
- Analysis of spatial control accuracy
- Multi-control conditioning experiments
- Evaluation of generation quality vs controllability

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding controllable generation architectures
- Experience with adapter-based model extensions
- Practical applications of precise spatial control

- ControlNet paper (Zhang et al., 2023)
- Control signal preprocessing techniques
- Adapter architectures in deep learning
