# Day 21: Denoising Diffusion GAN Hybrids

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a hybrid approach combining GANs with diffusion models (DDGAN style) to improve sample quality and training efficiency.

## 📋 Tasks

### GAN-Diffusion Hybrid
- **Implement a GAN-based discriminator to guide diffusion**
  - Add discriminator to standard diffusion training
  - Balance diffusion loss with adversarial loss
  - Handle multi-scale discrimination

### Training Dynamics
- **Analyze hybrid training stability**
  - Monitor generator/discriminator loss balance
  - Compare with pure diffusion training
  - Evaluate sample quality improvements

## 🏗️ DDGAN Architecture

### Components
- **Generator**: Standard diffusion UNet
- **Discriminator**: Multi-scale discriminator for different resolutions
- **Training**: Combined diffusion + adversarial objectives

### Loss Function
```
L_total = L_diffusion + λ_adv * L_adversarial
where:
L_diffusion = ||ε - ε_θ(x_t, t)||²
L_adversarial = -E[log D(x_0)] - E[log(1 - D(G(x_T)))]
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Start with smaller λ_adv and increase gradually
- Use spectral normalization in discriminator
- Implement multi-scale discrimination (different resolutions)
- Monitor mode collapse and training instability
- Use different learning rates for generator/discriminator

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Sample quality comparison: DDPM vs DDGAN
- Training loss curves for both components
- Analysis of training stability
- Evaluation metrics (FID, IS, precision/recall)
- Computational overhead analysis

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding hybrid generative architectures
- Experience with adversarial training dynamics
- Balancing multiple training objectives
