# Day 11: Latent Diffusion (VAE + Diffusion)

## 🎯 Objective
Implement latent diffusion by combining a VAE encoder/decoder with diffusion in the compressed latent space for computational efficiency.

## 📋 Tasks

### VAE Training
- **Train a VAE to compress images to latent space**
  - Design VAE with good reconstruction quality
  - Target compression ratio 8x or 16x (spatial dimensions)
  - Ensure stable latent space for diffusion training

### Latent Diffusion Training
- **Train DDPM in latent space**
  - Apply diffusion process to VAE latents instead of raw images
  - Modify UNet architecture for latent space dimensions
  - Train end-to-end or freeze VAE weights

## 🏗️ Architecture Pipeline

### Training Pipeline
```
Image x → VAE Encoder → z → Diffusion Process → z_t → UNet → pred_noise
```

### Sampling Pipeline
```
Noise z_T → DDPM Sampling → z_0 → VAE Decoder → Generated Image
```

### Key Components
- **VAE**: Encoder/Decoder with latent dim much smaller than image dim
- **UNet**: Adapted for latent space (different input/output channels)
- **Training**: Apply diffusion objective to latent codes z

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use VAE with KL-regularization for stable latent space
- Consider VAE reconstruction quality vs compression trade-off
- Adapt UNet input channels to latent dimension (e.g., 4 or 8 channels)
- Monitor both VAE reconstruction and diffusion losses
- Consider perceptual losses for better VAE training

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- VAE reconstruction quality analysis
- Computational efficiency comparison (latent vs pixel space)
- Sample quality evaluation of latent diffusion
- Memory usage and training time improvements
- Analysis of compression artifacts in final samples

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding computational efficiency in diffusion models
- Experience combining different generative model types
- Foundation for large-scale diffusion models (Stable Diffusion)
