# Day 27: Diffusion Policy (RL + Diffusion, 2023)

## 🎯 Objective
Train a diffusion model as a policy for reinforcement learning tasks, exploring how generative models can represent complex action distributions.

## 📋 Tasks

### Diffusion Policy Implementation
- **Train a diffusion model as policy on a small RL task**
  - Use diffusion to model action sequences
  - Train on expert demonstrations or online RL
  - Handle multi-step action prediction

### RL Application
- **CartPole trajectories or similar environment**
  - Generate action sequences conditioned on observations
  - Evaluate policy performance in environment
  - Compare with standard RL policy networks

## 🧮 Diffusion Policy Formulation

### Policy as Diffusion
```
π_θ(a|s) = diffusion model over actions conditioned on state s
Actions a_t: sampled from diffusion process
States s_t: environment observations
```

### Training Objective
```
L = E[(s,a)~D][||ε - ε_θ(noisy_a, t, s)||²]
where D is demonstration dataset or replay buffer
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Start with low-dimensional action spaces
- Use sequence modeling for temporal action dependencies
- Implement both imitation learning and online RL variants
- Handle action space normalization properly
- Consider computational constraints during environment interaction
