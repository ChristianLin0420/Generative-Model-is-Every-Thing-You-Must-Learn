# Day 3: Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Refresher

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a VAE from scratch and understand how it enables generation of new samples through learned probabilistic latent representations.

## 📋 Tasks

### Core Implementation
- **Implement a simple VAE from scratch**
  - Encoder network outputting mean (μ) and log-variance (logσ²)
  - Reparameterization trick for sampling
  - Decoder network for reconstruction
  - Combined ELBO loss (reconstruction + KL divergence)

### Generation & Analysis
- **Sample new images and compare with DAE**
  - Generate new samples from prior distribution N(0,I)
  - Compare generation quality with previous day's DAE
  - Analyze latent space interpolations

## 🏗️ Architecture Details
- **Encoder**: CNN/MLP → μ, logσ² vectors
- **Sampling**: z = μ + σ ⊙ ε where ε ~ N(0,I)
- **Decoder**: z → reconstructed image
- **Loss**: -ELBO = Reconstruction Loss + KL(q(z|x)||p(z))

## 📚 Key Concepts
- Variational inference principles
- Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)
- KL divergence regularization
- Reparameterization trick
- Latent variable models

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use `torch.distributions` for proper KL computation
- Balance reconstruction and KL terms (β-VAE variants)
- Initialize decoder bias to dataset mean
- Monitor KL collapse (posterior collapse)

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Training curves showing ELBO components
- Generated sample galleries
- Latent space interpolations
- Comparison: DAE reconstruction vs VAE generation
- Analysis of latent space structure

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of probabilistic generative models
