# Day 14: Diffusion for Super-Resolution

## 🎯 Objective
Train a diffusion model specifically for image super-resolution, learning to map low-resolution images to high-resolution versions.

## 📋 Tasks

### Super-Resolution Model
- **Train a diffusion model to map 16×16 → 32×32 images**
  - Create dataset of paired low-res/high-res images
  - Condition diffusion model on low-resolution input
  - Train to generate high-frequency details

### Architecture Design
- **Specialized architecture for super-resolution**
  - Input concatenation: [low_res_upsampled, noisy_high_res]
  - Modify UNet to handle multi-resolution inputs
  - Focus on learning residual high-frequency information

## 🏗️ Super-Resolution Pipeline

### Training Process
```
1. Downsample high-res image to create low-res version
2. Upsample low-res (bicubic) to target resolution
3. Apply diffusion to high-res image conditioned on upsampled low-res
4. Train to predict noise/residual
```

### Conditioning Strategy
- **Input Concatenation**: Concatenate upsampled low-res with noisy high-res
- **Cross-Attention**: Attend over low-res features
- **Residual Learning**: Focus on learning high-frequency details

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Use realistic downsampling (bicubic, antialiasing)
- Consider perceptual losses in addition to L2
- Implement progressive training (start with smaller upsampling factors)
- Compare with bicubic baseline and other super-resolution methods
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS)

## 📊 Expected Outputs
- Super-resolution sample comparisons (bicubic vs diffusion)
- Quantitative evaluation (PSNR, SSIM scores)
- Analysis of detail preservation and artifact generation
- Comparison with traditional super-resolution methods
- Computational efficiency analysis

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding task-specific diffusion applications
- Experience with conditional generation architectures
- Practical computer vision application of diffusion models
