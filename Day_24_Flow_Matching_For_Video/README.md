# Day 24: Flow Matching for Video

## 🎯 Objective
Extend flow matching to temporal sequences for short video clip generation, handling the additional time dimension in video data.

## 📋 Tasks

### Video Flow Matching
- **Extend FM to sequential frames**
  - Handle temporal dependencies in flow fields
  - Implement 3D convolutions or video-specific architectures
  - Design flow paths for video sequences

### Video Generation
- **Short video clip generation**
  - Generate coherent 8-16 frame sequences
  - Maintain temporal consistency and smooth motion
  - Condition on first frame or text descriptions

## 🏗️ Video Flow Architecture

### Temporal Modeling
- **3D UNet**: Extend spatial UNet with temporal convolutions
- **Video Transformer**: Attention across spatial and temporal dimensions
- **Factored Space-Time**: Separate spatial and temporal processing

### Flow Coupling for Video
```
Video sequence: v = [v_0, v_1, ..., v_T]
Flow path: v_t = (1-t)v_start + t*v_end
Velocity field: u(t, v_t) handles both spatial and temporal dimensions
```

## 🔧 Implementation Tips
- Start with short sequences (8 frames) and small resolution
- Use pre-trained image flow matching models as initialization
- Implement temporal consistency losses
- Consider memory constraints with video data
- Use frame interpolation for evaluation

## 📊 Expected Outputs
